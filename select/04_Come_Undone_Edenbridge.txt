I came from miles around
To holy ground
The riddance of my soul
To take control
So where are you?
With all my heart I try
To wish away the big goodbye

Whenever you are mine
Above the timberline
I'm bound for you aflame with my desire
Whenever I am here
Abundantly it's clear
I won't turn tail and run
I come undone

You're closer to the bone
A heavy stone
Kicking up a storm
A pain so warm
Shall I give in?
As straight as die my friend
The road has come to an end

Whenever you are mine
Above the timberline
I'm bound for you aflame with my desire
Whenever I am here
Abundantly it's clear
I won't turn tail and run
I come undone

Where I turn and I steer
It's all hope and fear
The current of time
The only port of call
Can save me from the fall
Can set it all alight

Whenever you are mine
Above the timberline
I'm bound for you aflame with my desire
Whenever I am here
Abundantly it's clear
I won't turn tail and run
I come undone
