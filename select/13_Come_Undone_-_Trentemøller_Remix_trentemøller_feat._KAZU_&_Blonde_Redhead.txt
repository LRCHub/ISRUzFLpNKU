Hey
May
You come undone, so
Why don't you let your hair down?

Your voice is my fate
Your touch is my text
I only wish to see nothing at all

You, so special, so they told me
So why still lie about yourself?

Your voice is my fate
Your touch is my text
I only wish to see nothing at all
Your master is my mind
Speak so loudly
I only wish I could want
Nothing at all

Your master is my mind
Speak, so softly
I only know I could want
Every time
