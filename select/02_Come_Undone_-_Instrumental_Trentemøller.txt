Hey, may you come undone,
So why don't you let your hair down?
Your voice is my fate
Your touch is my text
I only wish to see nothing at all
You, so special, so they told me
So why still lie about yourself?
Your voice is my fate
Your touch is my text
I only wish to see nothing at all
Your master is my mind,
Speak so loudly
I only wish i could want nothing at all
Your master is my mind,
Speak, so softly
I only know i could want
Every time
