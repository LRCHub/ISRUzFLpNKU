So unimpressed but so in awe
Such a saint but such a whore
So self aware so full of shit
So indecisive so adamant
I'm contemplating
thinking about thinking
It's overrated just get another
drink and Watch me come undone
They're selling razor blades
and mirrors in the street
come undone
I pray that when I'm
coming down you'll be asleep
come undone
If I ever hurt you
your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
and I'm your son
I come undone
I come undone
So rock and roll
so corporate suit
So damn ugly so damn cute
So well trained so animal
So need your love
so fuck you all
I'm not scared of dying
I just don't want to
If Id stop lying
I'd just disappoint you
I come undone come undone
They're selling razor
blades and mirrors in the street
come undone
I pray that when I'm
coming down you'll be asleep
come undone
If I ever hurt you
your revenge will be so sweet
Because I'm scum
and I'm your son
I come undone
So write another ballad
Mix it on a Wednesday
Sell it on a Thursday
Buy a yacht by Sunday
It's a love song
A love song
Do another interview
Sing a bunch of lies
Tell about celebrities
that I despise
And sing love songs
We sing love songs
So sincere So sincere
come undone
They're selling razor
blades and mirrors in the street
come undone
I pray that when I'm
coming down you'll be asleep
come undone
A young pretender and my
crowds above can see
I come undone
I am scum
Love your son
You gotta love your son
You gotta love your son
Love your son
I am scum I am scum I am scum
I am scum I am scum I am scum
