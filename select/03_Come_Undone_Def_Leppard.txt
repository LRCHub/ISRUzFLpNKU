Come on in, welcome, enter
We've got your front row center
For the Freak-show parade

Everybody wants to be you
But I know you see right through
A sad masquarade

Wrap your arms around me like a wire
You reach into my soul
Pull out the fire

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could touch me when I call out your name

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could put me back together again

You've got what it takes to make me
So won't you come and shake me
Out of this haze (out of this haze)

All tomorrow's dreams you're sellin'
God knows what he's not tellin'
He's had better days

I wait to hear a voice above me callin'
You drag me to my knees
But I'm still fallin'

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could touch me when I call out your name

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could put me back together again

I can't close my eyes
Can't hide the fear
I feel the earth beneath my feet disappear

I'm out of words
I'm out of time
Give me your hand
Reach out for mine

Wrap your arms around me like a wire
You reach into my soul
Pull out the fire

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could touch me when I call out your name

When I come undone
I know you're the only one
Who could put me back together again
Who could put me back together again
